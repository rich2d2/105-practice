                <h4>Mind the battle of <span>ideas</span></h4>
                <p>Since starting to learn web development I noticed that there are two competing lines of thinking. The first string of thoughts are my desire for safety and comfort. Primarily, these thoughts say, "You are wasting your time, everyone else knows way more than you. It's easy for them and hard for you."</p>
    
                <p>I agreed with it once and stopped coding for about a year. I got stuck and didn't know what to do next and gave in to the status quo. I regret it.</p>
 
                <p>The other round of discussion in my mind wants a better life. There is courage in these thoughts. It says things like,"Hard work will pay off, keep at it and go for the reward. If you don't get it right today, try again tomorrow. Don't give up!" 
                </p>
 
                <h4><span>Wisdom</span>: navigating the competition of ideas</h4>
                <p>I don't want to be foolhardy and I don't want to be complacent. Today I am listening to the courageous voices, because they seem the most true. Coding might not be for everyone, but to know if it is right for me  a wholehearted followthrough is key.</p>
 
                <p>Struggle is a normal part of learning. If I give up to soon, I will never know what is possible and I may miss a great future.</p>
                
                <h4>Choose the best <span>ideas</span></h4>
                <p>Choose to ignore the desire for comfort and safety. Be vulnerable and admit to weak areas that need strengthening. Complete what you start. See it through to the end and find out what is possible for your life.</p>
